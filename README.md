# Go Language Skills Evaluation

## Intermediate Level Questions

1. **How would you implement a custom struct to represent a `Person` with fields like `Name`, `Age`, and a slice of `Friends`? Write a function to add friends and display the details.**

2. **Write a Go program to swap two numbers using a function. Explain how Go passes values to functions (by value or by reference).**

3. **How do you declare and initialize a multi-dimensional array in Go? Provide an example of a 2D array and show how you would iterate over it.**

4. **Explain the difference between `var` and `:=` when declaring variables in Go. Can you use them interchangeably in all situations?**

5. **How would you implement a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the maximum and minimum values?**

6. **Write a Go program that demonstrates the use of a `switch` statement with multiple case conditions. Include a `default` case that handles unexpected values.**

7. **Create a Go function that accepts a map of string keys and integer values. The function should calculate and return the sum of the map's values.**

8. **Write a Go program to reverse a string. Explain how strings are handled differently from arrays in Go.**

9. **Demonstrate how to use a `for` loop to iterate through both keys and values of a map in Go.**

10. **How would you create a constant block in Go? Provide an example where multiple related constants are declared together, such as days of the week.**
